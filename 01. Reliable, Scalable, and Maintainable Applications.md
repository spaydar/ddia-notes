# 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
- Commonly needed functionality of data-intensive applications:
  - Databases
    - Store data so it can be found again later
  - Caches
    - Remember the result of an expensive operation to speed up reads
  - Search Indexes
    - Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways
  - Stream Processing
    - Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously
  - Batch Processing
    - Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data
- Three concerns that are important in most software systems:
  - Reliability
    - The system should continue to work _correctly_ 
      - performing the correct function at the desired level of performance 
    - even in the face of _adversity_
      - hardware or software faults, and even human error
  - Scalability
    - As the system _grows_,
      - in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity
    - there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth
  - Maintainability
    - Over time, the many people who work on the system should be able to do so _productively_
      - engineering and operations
      - maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use cases
