# 1. Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications
- Commonly needed functionality of data-intensive applications:
  - Databases
    - Store data so it can be found again later
  - Caches
    - Remember the result of an expensive operation to speed up reads
  - Search Indexes
    - Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways
  - Stream Processing
    - Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously
  - Batch Processing
    - Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data
- Three concerns that are important in most software systems:
  - Reliability
    - The system should continue to work _correctly_ 
      - performing the correct function at the desired level of performance 
    - even in the face of _adversity_
      - hardware or software faults, and even human error
  - Scalability
    - As the system _grows_,
      - in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity
    - there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth
  - Maintainability
    - Over time, the many people who work on the system should be able to do so _productively_
      - engineering and operations
      - maintaining current behavior and adapting the system to new use cases
## Reliability
- Software reliability typically means:
  - The application performs the function that the user expected
  - It can tolerate the user making mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways
  - Its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volume
  - The system prevents any unauthorized access and abuse
- Faults
  - Things that can go wrong
  - One component of a system deviating from its spec
- Failure
  - When a system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user
- It is usually best to design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failures
  - This is because it is impossible to reduce the probability of a fault to zero
- It can make sense to deliberately induce faults 
  - to ensure fault-tolerance machinery is continually exercised and tested
  - e.g. the Netflix _Chaos Monkey_
### Hardware Faults
